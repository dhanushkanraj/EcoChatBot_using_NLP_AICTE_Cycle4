# EcoChatBot_using_NLP_AICTE_Cycle4
Training for the Project on Implementation of Chatbot using NLP

**EcoChatBot** is a chatbot developed to assist users with eco-friendly practices, energy conservation tips, recycling guidance, and sustainable living advice. The chatbot leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Logistic Regression** model to interpret user input and respond intelligently.

The project demonstrates how AI and machine learning can be used to provide helpful and context-aware answers in real-time. The chatbot can answer questions about:
- **Energy conservation**
- **Recycling practices**
- **Eco-friendly products**
- **Sustainable living tips**




streamlit run chatbot.py
This command should be run from the terminal. Make sure you are in the project directory, where chatbot.py is located, before running it. You can use the terminal in Visual Studio Code or the Mac/Linux terminal.



Conversation History: The chatbot also keeps a log of interactions, which is stored in chat_log.csv. You can review this log to see previous conversations with the chatbot.

By running this project, will gain insights into how a chatbot can be trained and deployed using NLP techniques and machine learning models. This project can be expanded to include more sophisticated techniques or even integrate additional datasets for a more advanced chatbot.




This version of the "About EcoChatBot" section is tailored for easy understanding and clear instructions on how to get started with the project.
